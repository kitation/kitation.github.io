<p><strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Dissertation</strong></p>
<p>My undergraduate dissertation was about the perceptions of software engineering and how it effects women's career choices. It covers a definition of software engineering, the importance of diversity, issues in education and the workplace as well as my own research and analysis of that research.</p>
<p>You can download it <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1013820/Project-public.pdf">here</a>. Sharing is allowed but should be referenced to Claire Gowler and link to this page. I also did a small presentation on this work which you can find at the Gist Mag page on the menu bar above.</p>
