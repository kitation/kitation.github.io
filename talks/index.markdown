## Active talks

If your event or organisation is interested in any of these talks, please contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kitation) or via email (hello /AT/ kitation.co.uk).

### Working Through The Problem: How Developers Can Get Involved With Research

We talk a lot about user research being a “team sport” but this doesn’t always work out in reality. It can be tricky for non-researchers to make time in their schedules on something not seen as their “day job”.

This talk is about why taking part in user research is a vital task for developers, ways you can start talking to dev teams and managers about making space in sprints for research, and how analysis can create a better product. We will also look at how to do research without a researcher effectively and where even small amounts of research can yield important insights.

Available as a 30 min talk.

### Uncomfortable Experiences In Digital Games

While there is an increasing amount of research in the player experience area, little work has been done specifically around discomfort in digital games and what this means. This talk covers two studies that look at the experience, causes and motivations behind the play of games that induce discomfort. An analysis of Steam reviews and a follow-up questionnaire study focusing on asking participants about uncomfortable experiences in Darkest Dungeon, Papers Please and Fallout 4 were used to try and define discomfort; this talk will discuss what was found and what this means for game design and player experience.

This talk is based on my Master's dissertation, more information about that can be found on the [Games Research](https://kitation.co.uk/project) page. It is 30 minutes long and has been given at Manchester Barcamp and London Unread Meetup. [Find the video here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13397-uncomfortable-experiences-in-digital-games)

### Mental Health in Agile Workplaces

Most of us will be affected by a mental health issue at some point in our lives, and this high-pressure, fast-paced industry can make coping difficult. We all want to do our jobs well, but sometimes we need a bit of extra support.
This talk will explain why people can struggle and how to change touchpoints like meetings, code review and timesheets to make the day-to-day easier to navigate. We will cover how to start conversations with people in your team and how small changes in language can make a big difference.

This talk is a 30 minute conference talk and has been given at Alterconf and PyconUK as well as internally at work.

### Asking about Gender

*Only available on a consultant/paid basis, contact for fees*

As we move towards more customised experiences for our users, why do we still insist on using the black boxes of male and female when asking users about their gender? And why are we asking for it in the first place? Between 1 and 5 percent of the UK population identifies as having a non-binary gender or are transgender. This talk aims to help developers ask users about their gender in a useful and sensitive manner; educate on what non-binary means and what other issues non-binary and gender variant users may face when using the web.
