*Spoiler Warning: This post will have spoilers for Nier Ending A and B. I haven't finished Ending C or D at time of writing so please don't spoil me either*

I remember playing Nier a year or so after it came out and not getting along with it. Partially because the first sidequest I picked up was the one where you can break the thing you're delivering and partially because I'd only played turn based JRPGs up to this point and my skills were lacking. Years later with all the Souls games under my belt and a strong desire to play Nier Automata I thought I'd revisit it.

This game has possessed me.

It's actually really hard to write reviews or thoughts on games for me. Often the thing I love about a game is actually hard to describe after the fact; there's something about the experience that carries you and lingers with you that's wordless, it's just feelings. However it's very easy to think of things that are not so good about the game, because they are things that disconnect you from that experience. So I'm starting with a few of those, and then I can get on with the nonsensical praise.

The way Nier comforts Emil after the body change is one of the best scenes in the game. The voice acting for Emil in his emotional scenes is so good. It's jarring then when Nier's response to the Ulitmate Weapon at the Aerie is basically "yeah you killed everyone but we're ok so meh". I think it ruins what should be a powerful scene and made me so angry at the character I was supposed to "be".

Kaine would be a better character with trousers on. It does remove the gravitas from some of her scenes when you're looking at her barely covered butt. I had the same issue in Automata where some serious moments are marred by a camera angle showing off 2B's underclothes.
