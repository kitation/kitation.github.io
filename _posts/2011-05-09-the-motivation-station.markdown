<p>Motivation is a funny thing. It comes in spurts followed by silences, and often from nowhere and not always at the right time. Being a hardcore procrastinator gives you a wonderful ability to get a lot of work done at the "last minute" and it becomes difficult not to rely on that skill, especially when you try to use it to defy the laws of time and space.</p>
<p>This is procrastination. I'm working on the last assignment of my university career. I've also got four exams but I don't tend to worry about those, I have some kind of revision plan and I've always been a crammer. I am struggling to stay motivated despite this being the final push. With the dissertation and other hand-ins last week, I have been at a state of near hysterical panic for the last month or so and I'm all burned out. A person can only have a finite amount of care before they need to stop and breathe to refill. Personal difficulties haven't helped much, my granddad died a week ago and grief is a harder emotion to bear that I'd thought. Living so far from home at a time like this is both a blessing and a burden, I want to help more but I'm grateful I've had my own space to deal with things. I'll miss the funeral because of exams and hospital commitments. </p>
<p>Transitional periods are always weird aren't they? Some of my procrastination has been spent looking into the future. So far work is hard to find and the one job I've applied for doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I was hoping that four years of a degree would give me the epiphany of how I wanted to spend my life and that hasn't happened yet. I have been looking at something related to user experience, or maybe technical writing. Something software related but not necessarily coding. It's not that I dislike coding, but for this year at least coding has been associated with panic, annoyance and hacky rush jobs. Once the exams are done I can look properly. I'm on Linked In so I hope that helps a bit. At some point I will write a blogpost about university and how it has and hasn't changed my outlook.</p>
<p>I need something to be passionate about. After the general election I was really interested in electoral reform, and I guess I am interested in the question of how politics fits in around the current world. This interest didn't really last up to the AV referendum, partially because of university and partially before all the dickery on both sides just deadened any enthusiasm. I obviously follow a lot of glbt politics as well as issues around sexuality and censorship. If possible I would love a career doing something for a organisation that deals in this kind of stuff. </p>
<p>I was hoping all this would have a point instead of reading like a slightly better written Livejournal rant. There is just so much going on right now my heart and mind fill jampacked. Ah well, this Java won't write itself.</p>
