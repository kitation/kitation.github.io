<p>&gt;A song that reminds me of someone. I do tend to do this quite a lot, like I could make mini-albums for people I really like and stuff. They don't always make sense because sometimes it's just one lyric that reminds me of that person instead of the entire song. Or maybe it's not the lyrics, it's the title or it was playing when I was in their company. This song is kinda all three and I've picked this song because it reminds me of three people. If that's cheating a little then meh.</p>

<p>I'm terrible for nicknaming people, like I call people love or chick or sweetheart a lot. This started back when I worked at Gamestation and I gave all the guys there nicknames. Only two really stuck, our Saturday boy "princess" and my assistant manager ended up being called "flower", a nickname he used to sign my goodbye card so I like to think he was fond of it. Anyway, we were pretty close in lots of ways, we're incredibly similar but for whatever reasons he doesn't do the "friends with coworkers" thing and we lost touch. Hana is japanese for flower, and so I have a lot of J-rock songs called Hana or with hana in the title. Person 1.</p>
<p>Person 2 is Bill, the friend I emo-ed about for yesterday's song. We were friends in WoW and we met up in London once and I had this song in my ears when I ran down the stairs at the train station to meet him. </p>
<p>Last but not least, person 3 is Katie. This is one of the few J-rock songs she likes too, and when we saw them live we were both disappointed they didn't play this song. And so it always makes me think of her. Our tastes in music have split a little as we've gotten older and so it's awesome to still have these songs of shared connection.</p>
