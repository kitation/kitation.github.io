<p>&gt;A friend told me about this a few days ago and I thought it would be fun. I don't care that I may or may not be late to the party. It's very self-indulgent, I'm well aware no-one really gives a toss about what songs I pick and why, it's much more for me to stick my thoughts and feelings out there. Feeling kinda reflective lately and this is a better exercise than leaving emo about everywhere. So..
<ul>
<li>Day&nbsp;01 – Your favourite song</li>
<li>Day 02 – Your least favourite song</li>
<li>Day 03 – A song that makes you happy</li>
<li>Day 04 – A song that makes you sad</li>
<li>Day 05 – A song that reminds you of someone</li>
<li>Day 06 – A song that reminds you of somewhere</li>
<li>Day 07 – A song that reminds you of a certain event</li>
<li>Day 08 – A song that you know all the words to</li>
<li>Day 09 – A song that you can dance to</li>
<li>Day 10 – A song that makes you fall asleep</li>
<li>Day 11 – A song from your favourite band</li>
<li>Day 12 – A song from a band you hate</li>
<li>Day 13 – A song that is a guilty pleasure</li>
<li>Day 14 – A song that no one would expect you to love</li>
<li>Day 15 – A song that describes you</li>
<li>Day 16 – A song that you used to love but now hate</li>
<li>Day 17 – A song that you hear often on the radio</li>
<li>Day 18 – A song that you wish you heard on the radio</li>
<li>Day 19 – A song from your favourite album</li>
<li>Day 20 – A song that you listen to when you’re angry</li>
<li>Day 21 – A song that you listen to when you’re happy</li>
<li>Day 22 – A song that you listen to when you’re sad</li>
<li>Day 23 – A song that you want to play at your wedding</li>
<li>Day 24 – A song that you want to play at your funeral</li>
<li>Day 25 – A song that makes you laugh</li>
<li>Day 26 – A song that you can play on an instrument</li>
<li>Day 27 – A song that you wish you could play</li>
<li>Day 28 – A song that makes you feel guilty</li>
<li>Day 29 – A song from your childhood</li>
<li>Day 30 – Your favorite song at this time last year</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the gist of it I guess :)&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>Day 1 - Your favourite song</u><br />This is always really hard to answer. Favourite songs change all the time, plus I don't wanna pick a song now I might need later. So is this my favourite right now, or my favourite of all time or what? This song is my favourite right now, and has been for about a year or so. I kinda liked the studio version ever since I heard it years ago, but it didn't hit "favourite song" status until I heard the live version.<br /><b>Coheed and Cambria - Delirium Trigger</b></p>

<p>Nothing much gets me going like this pumping in my headphones, the lyrics are quotably emo but the crowd interaction really make this track literally awesome, almost spiritual so, and I always have to resist the urge to scream it out loud as I walk along. Amazing stuff. For those that don't know, Coheed and Cambria are a concept band. This song is from their first album (second album in the story), story be <a href="http://cobaltandcalcium.com/story/the-second-stage-turbine-blade/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I got into them because one of the guys I worked with at Gamestation was really into them and I'm a bit of a sucker for concept albums. Saw them live last summer and it was absolutely amazing. They will probably show up again later but if not check out the tracks In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth, Welcome Home, Here We Are Juggernaut and Mother Superior.</p>
