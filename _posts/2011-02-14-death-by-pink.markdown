<p>&gt;My intense dislike of Valentine's day is kinda weird, and perhaps not entirely rational. After all I'm in a long-term happy relationship, and although it's been stressful and manic and heartbreaking in places I couldn't go through life without her. This isn't really about people like me, or other people who see Valentines just as a nice excuse to treat themselves after a soul-sucking January. It's just my opinion, and I know many people would say I was missing the point, or being too cynical and judgemental.</p>
<p>Cheap tat is an easy target I guess. Nothing says "I love you" like a 99p plastic monkey holding an off-shaped heart in his Made In China paws. And I dislike greetings cards in general, they are awesome for things like relatives or friends you don't often see, but to someone in the same house? I just think it's a waste. You know I'm wishing you a happy birthday because I'm doing it *right now*, why do I need to write it down for you? The only Valentines card I ever bought Katie was before we were going out. </p>
<p>Couples celebrate and single people mope. Perversely I always seem to prefer moping with the loners, I celebrate my relationship on our anniversary and so Valentines ends up making me think more about old friends and crushes that over the years I've left behind. I am a pretty romantic person, and I'm all for true love and soulmates and all that girly crap. And it's so female-focused isn't it? Come on girls, you deserve toys and balloons and jewellery. At least that's what the shops will tell you. I know that's not just a Valentine thing but it irks me more this holiday than any other. It's all red and pink and sparkly. And everyone has to have a go, buy a heart shaped cucumber! Or a pink laptop if she's a nerd because all girls love pink electronics. (I do have a pink PSP though, so hypocritical somewhat). And bleh bleh hetronormative. Would it kill one company to have a gay or lesbian couple on a poster somewhere? When's the holiday for the dudes? Steak and blowjob day doesn't count, although I celebrate that anyway because hey, steak is good. </p>
<p>If you love someone, then great. Use it as a day to tell them how you feel, or treat them, or buy them something they'd really love. But don't buy her the last flowers in the shop and pretend you're oh so romantic. If you're single and alone, cheer yourself up with cheap chocolate tomorrow. And if you're an old cynic like me, sit down and write a blogpost instead of getting on with some real work. Show your love how you want to and when you want to, screw some stupid 'holiday'.</p>
