<p>&gt;A song that makes me happy! This one was really easy. It's so impossible for me to be miserable to this song that I have to skip it when I'm feeling "wallow in my misery" type emo. This band are likely to appear a lot in this challenge. </p>

<p>The brash happy enthusiasm of the SID chip never fails to inspire and brighten me. This track was entered for a game music contest but was disallowed because the band were signed. I also love it because it came out pretty close to my birthday. You can download this track and a fuckton of others from <a href="http://machinaesupremacy.com/music/">Site Releases here.</a> Machinae Supremacy mean a lot to me, they got me through some pretty tough times and their music always gives me confidence that my world is mine to shape how I will and fuck the haters.</p>
