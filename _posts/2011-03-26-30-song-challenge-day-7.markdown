<p>Been doing this for a week now, it's been a good way to use the time when I inexplicably wake up before 6am. I know it's a little bit teenage and a little bit "emo" but I love this kinda stuff, even if it is spam. </p>
<p>A song for an specific event. This one came to me a couple of days ago as it came on my iPod while I was walking to university. </p>

<p>In 2004, I went with Katie and her friends to my first and so far only anime convention. I was between jobs and had fuck all money until my first Gamestation pay packet but that was due after the con so I got a credit card. Think I spent about Â£400 in a single weekend. I didn't really watch a lot of anime, I mostly remember walking to Asda in the rain, getting horribly drunk and watching/playing a copious amount of DDR. And hot cosplayers. And some stoned rasta telling me how pretty I was o_O Anyway, this song was playing during the J-rock club night. I wasn't really into japanese music back then but this track is so fast and happy and awesome it always makes me smile.</p>
