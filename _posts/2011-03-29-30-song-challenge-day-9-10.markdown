<p>Eeek, forgot yesterday. I have not picked the best time to try this but I shall not give up! I may however cheat a little. </p>
<p>Day 9, a song I can dance to! I can't dance. I can move while music is playing but that's pretty much it. So instead this song is one I like to dance to, it's generally my "dance in the uni lift" track.</p>

<p>I love this track so much, it's probably my favourite electronic track. It also comes from one of my favourite games Rez. It's an on-rails shooter to music, which sounds wank but with the stereo up it's amazing. It's on Xbox Live Arcade too. It's my drug, it's the best stress relief for when uni work is really getting me down. Win. </p>
<p>Day 10, a song I fall asleep to. When I visit my parents I can never sleep and I often stay up until stupid o'clock in the morning with my laptop or my ipod in. </p>

<p>Not sure why this song in particular, I can sleep to some pretty noisy stuff, but this has the right kind of pace and lyrics to help me drift off when I need to.</p>
