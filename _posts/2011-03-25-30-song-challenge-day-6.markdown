<p>So day 6, a song that reminds me of somewhere. This one is pretty hard. I have lots of songs that remind me of events which make me think of the places the events happened in, but there's not really any songs that make me go "Oh, this song reminds me of Sheffield" or whatever. This song I guess is the closest.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the train from Reading to Sheffield when Katie was at uni and I still lived at home down south. Lyrically it doesn't really fit but I used to love listening to it when gazing out at the countryside flying by the window as the train took me up to see her. Home isn't a place, it's a person and it's her. </p>
