  content: ! 'Thanks for the post, Chad.


    The separation of self is a topic I''ve been thinking about recently as well,
    I haven''t come to any good conclusions as of yet, so I''m keeping it all in one
    places until I get feedback to the contrary.


    On the subject of writing about software development, your experiences are valuable,
    they are an opportunity for learning. There are no absolute wrong and write ways
    to do or to think about the subject. Writing them down may help you to form your
    ideas, publishing will allow you to receive feedback, which in turn will help
    you learn.

  content: ! "My obvious concern is job hunting, and I don't want employers to be
    put of by my weirdness. Then again, any employer who thinks me having an opinion
    is a problem isn't someone I really want to work for. \n\nThe software thing isn't
    so much about being criticised, but more \"look at that poor girl, so naive and
    idealistic! Just wait till she learns about the real world.\" I'd like to stay
    idealistic for as long as possible!"

  content: ! "Thanks for replying to my comment.\n\nI may be biased upon the job hunting
    issues, as my opinion (which is possibly a little self righteous) is that an organisation
    is hiring me as a person, not just a set of skills. As such, unless I do or say
    something which brings disrepute or is disrespectful, I should be free to have
    personal opinions. \n\nIf this becomes a big concern, then splitting into multiple
    blogs may help you to feel more comfortable writing about some of these topics.\n\nThe
    best advice I can offer for if people tell you to grow up/face the real world
    is to  try and help them understand that different opinions and points of view
    are valuable, even if perceived as naive. If this is not successful, then just
    ignore them. You're opinions and thoughts will change at your pace, they cannot
    force you to do it faster than you want."

<p>Welp, got my own webserver at last. I say my own, it's Katie's really but I bought my domain name so it kinda counts right? I do like Blogger, and after all this messing around I kinda miss it. Wordpress's importer tool doesn't work so I'll have to get round to copy/pasting posts across but I don't have many so that's alright.</p>
<p>I've been thinking hard about what a blog should be. I'm torn between the idea of a blog being me as a professional person writing about interesting things, and about it as an emotional dumping ground. Both are equally unappealing in different ways. I expect that this division of self happens a lot to people like me who live on the net, we all have personas that we create to protect us but then they also hide us from the people we really want to let in. In the end all I have are my opinions and my experiences and if I am the only one interested so be it. We are showy people, we say "attention whore" like it's a bad word when it's just human nature. Throw our emotions at the way to see what sticks.</p>
<p>I'm also somewhat aware that I'm interested in some things that aren't really polite conversation and I worry about posting about those things. I worry as well about my inexperience as a software developer and so I don't want to write up some big post about something and turn out to be talking out of my arse. I'm enjoying the 30 songs/30 days so I'll keep that going, and my game review/rants and maybe I'll look into writing up some of the queer theory/fetish/sex-positive stuff I've been absorbing lately. I might even finish my "autobiography" sometime. Not vain, just bored!</p>
