<p>Saturday was surreal but amazing. Me and Katie got into Manchester early afternoon, checked into our hotel and wandered around town until 5pm. We'd arranged to meet some of the guys from the forum and so we went to drink with them before the gig. Tickets said doors open at 7:30 and at about half 6 we debated going down early to see if we could catch the band before the gig. Get there at 6:45 and they were letting people in already, which was weird, until standing in the bar we heard the unmistakable sound of SID in the air and much swearing and running across the venue ensued. </p>
<p>So lucky we caught the last two songs. We knew their set would be short as it's a 4-band tour in the UK (3 bands in the rest of europe) but if we'd gone by the time on the ticket we'd have missed them, and half of Ensiferum as well. Â£12.50 a song? Well worth it and I'd do it over again. For an opening band they got a really good reception, the band were getting us to clap along and sing along. For the first song we saw, Rocket Dragon, I think my enthusiastic singing was getting annoying for the dude in front of me who had suddenly found himself surrounded by manic fans of a band he's never heard of before; but by halfway through Through the Looking Glass he was smiling and clapping along with the rest of us. </p>
<p>I know there's a debate about whether you should wear a band's shirt to their shows but with 4 bands on it was really useful to be able to pick out the Machinae fans. The band came to meet us in the bar and pretty soon our group of seven turned into a mini-army swapping hugs, handshakes and thanks with the band.</p>

<p> By this time half 7 had been and gone and a large percentage of our group was made up of those who had totally missed them. A lot of plans were made to catch them in Birmingham or Nottingham instead and I heard at least one guy get promised he'd get in for free. If I didn't have the project this week I'd have gone to Nottingham as well. </p>
<p>I didn't talk to them as much as I liked, shyness and sleepiness combined into epic fail but I shook everyone's hand and thanked them and said how much I enjoyed it. Got an old tshirt signed which Dezo really liked and I'm so so proud of. Gonna get it framed and up on my wall. I'm sure someone in the band still has my marker, seeing as I was the only one with enough foresight to bring one. I'd always wanted to wear this shirt to the gig but it's old and a bit battered now, but it has served a much more awesome purpose.</p>

<p>I met so many awesome people, the other fans were amazing and it's great to have met all these people who love this band as much as I do. I also tried my first Jagerbomb and really liked it which does not bode well for my future. I feel kinda sad today and yesterday though, I really wish I'd said more to the guys but I am totally stoked for next time. They said their management was really surprised and happy with the great reception they'd been getting and they were as annoyed as us about the whole time fuckup. </p>
<p>I love this band. They are my greatest pick-me-up and my greatest inspiration. They are the only band I've heard that really balance the electronic and metal in a way that doesn't detract from either and unlike other chip-metal the SID chip is a warmer, more intricate sound than NES or Gameboy chiptunes. The lyrics are about personal revolution and rebellion with the odd gaming reference thrown in for good measure. They started out doing game covers and then giving original music away for free online, a fairly novel thing in 2002/3. You can still get that free stuff <a href="http://machinaesupremacy.com/music/">here</a> under Site Releases, and the Jets'n'Guns soundtrack is also free from that link. The last two albums are also on itunes and amazon mp3, and a collection album is available too. Check them out!</p>
