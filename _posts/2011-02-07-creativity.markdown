<p>&gt;I know, I know. I should be doing 1) uni work and 2) finishing up my Machinae Supremacy review. That's kinda what this is about. NB: There will be links to my epic fails at the end, not all my creative work is worksafe/mindsafe/any good.</p>
<p>I've always loved writing. From a kid writing kid stories to an older kid getting my poetry put in books and on teacher's walls on to the poetic emo mess of my teenage years via the murky waters of fanfiction. It's given me friends, helped me connect with people and give me an outlet for my emotions in a way that nothing else has. However, I never felt that I've really grown out of that teenage phase. Most of my poetry is still about lost friends and broken feelings. Every story project I've started has fallen on its face.</p>
<p>I think it is what draws me to RPGs and roleplaying in general. I don't really have to write anything for that, I just have to be somebody. I weave a new face for myself; a caricature of my own characteristics from spoilt dwarven princess with a lack of morality to a wild male elf whose carefree attitude was broken by a love and a loss[1]. I don't have to write the world or the story, I just see their thoughts and their flaws.</p>
<p>This is my point. As I get older I find it harder to get thoughts on paper. Poems that live in my head never quite know how to hit the page, and as I said before my story projects just fail. I started NaNoWriMo[2] last year but shit happened and I barely started it, and this year it's an obvious non-starter. I wrote a poem for the university poetry competition in my second year[3] but missed the deadline. I don't know what it is. I can't create using a computer, I much prefer pen to paper but when it comes to typing things up I either get bored or hate it so much when I read it back I don't bother. </p>
<p>I have never wanted so badly to reconnect with something. I did finish a 2000 word short story last year[4] and I've got another in the same universe on the go. I've still got the beginning of my old NaNo project as well as a new project I started of a girl's diary during a future time of power shortage[5]. When I get uni out of the way I'll try again. My children deserve worlds to play in and people to play with :-) Tips/tricks/sharing always welcome.</p>
