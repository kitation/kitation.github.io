<p>A song by my favourite band? This is kinda hard, I have so many songs by the band I absolutely love, hard to pick just one. The band is obviously Machinae Supremacy, but what song is best as an introduction? The chiptastic Jets'n'Guns soundtracks? The metalicious Fury? The heart-swelling Through the Looking Glass?</p>

<p>In the end I've gone with Shinigami, iTunes says it's my most played song and it's my favourite from the new album so it'll do. It's my "fuck fuck get ready you're already late" pick-me-up tune and I've pulled a neck muscle a few times while headbanging and teeth-brushing at the same time. </p>
<p>A song by a band I hate. I'm not a rap fan at all, or really a big fan of this album but it's fucking fun to dance to when drunk in corp. And Katie hates it, so I have at least one song to counter her Katy Perry fanness.</p>
