<p>&gt;A song that makes me sad? The advantage to being a raging emo with the emotional maturity of a spoon is that I have a whole playlist of songs that make me all sad, weepy and "I'll never love again!" stupid. But there is one song, much like yesterday, that always invokes a tearful sadness in me no matter my mood.</p>

<p>I got into Snow Patrol in 2007, I felt under a lot of pressure to get into some "normal" music. This entire album is good emo fodder but something about the song always gets to me. It reminds me of a friend I had at that time who I loved and then lost and I don't think he'll ever come back to me. I don't think about him a lot, but when I hear this I just wish I could go back and fix all the things I did wrong. A reminder of my constant mistakes and their empty space. Perhaps this isn't the best blogpost to write first thing in the morning, but bleh.</p>
