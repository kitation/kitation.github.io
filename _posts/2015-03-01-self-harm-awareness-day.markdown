Today is Self Injury Awareness Day. Every year I want to write a blog post for it but I find it very difficult. The biggest reason for this is that I find it hard to decide if I have a problem or not. I also feel like it’s a bit selfish just to talk about myself when there are millions of people who have it so much worse than I do. 

I want to write this post as an adult speaking to other adults about their teenagers. Self-harm is seen as a teenage problem; selfish cries for attention that go away once these kids grow up and learn about real hardship. I want to say that this perception is not only wrong, it is actively harmful. If you are a parent and you hold this view you are hurting your teenage children. Let’s take it one step at a time.

The majority of self-harmers do grow out of it. Or rather they stop harming themselves in the way that we call ‘self-harm’. They do not necessarily stop having the problems and feelings that made them self-harm in the first place. They do not stop having the memories of those feelings, and how parents, friends and teachers reacted to them. I find it hard to talk about my mental issues because everyone I spoke to as a teenager dismissed them. It was the music I was listening to, the people I hung around with, the films I watched, and the websites I visited. 

I am one of the teenage self-harmers who didn’t grow out of it. I do it much less and it’s a bit more subtle but I can’t hide from the fact that I am a 31 year old person who cuts. I also self-harm by not treating my body properly, for example, I leave medical conditions untreated because I don’t feel that my body is worth fixing. 

Was it for attention? No, not at first. What I think is at the heart of my self-harming, and that of others I have spoken to, is control. The idea that you cannot hurt me more than I can hurt myself, and so your hurt is easy to dismiss. The idea that this is my body, I own it and you do not therefore I can do what I please to it. I do think part of it was for attention; I was having feelings I couldn’t really name and found it hard to talk about, and I hoped that by getting ‘caught’ self-harming, people would start that conversation for me and I could feel less ashamed. That didn’t happen, and so I’m still scared of having this conversation. These days, I do it for the simple reason that it helps. The post-cut euphoria is worth it. Sometimes I crave it, but I do my best to ignore those times.

When you look at teenage me she did have it pretty good. She’s white, middle class, and intelligent in the expected way. The problem is though that nobody really understands her. Being a teenager is hard and we forget that as we get older. We look at teenagers from our lofty position as adults and condemn them for being weird, or bored, or disenfranchised. In return, they do not trust us, they cannot talk to us. I can’t stress this enough.

**If you dismiss your self-harming child, they will never trust you.**

My friends were my support network but we were all cutting. I didn’t know that this wasn’t a ‘normal’ part of growing up until fairly recently. We knew we couldn’t talk to our parents, they didn’t want to fix us, they just wanted to take our knives away and not talk about it.

The mental health system in this country is not good for teenagers. There is a terrible gap between child and adult mental care. When I was 19 I was referred to a social worker after I complained about side effects of my antidepressants, and she sent me to be assessed by a psychologist. The psychologist recommended therapy, but as I was an ‘adult’ I could either wait 3 years for 1-to-1 therapy or I could go to group therapy with a bunch of people old enough to be my parents. There was no such thing as group therapy with people my own age and I felt that I wouldn’t have much in common with people in their 40s and so I never went back. I hope it’s better now, but I worry that’s not the case.

I have never been formally diagnosed with a mental illness. I have been referred to therapy as above, online therapy, and I’ve seen two counsellors. I’ve been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs several times and had a spell on beta blockers to help my panic attacks. Drugs are much too easy to get. I know that I don’t emotionally react in the way that other people do, I know that self-harm is unhealthy but the drugs feel worse and nothing else is available.

I am an adult, I have a job and a house and a girlfriend and I cut. It’s been 16 years since I started. The thing that has stayed with me the most is that talking about mental illness is hard. It shouldn’t be. Listen to your kids, otherwise in 15 years they will be where I am, and I don’t want that. Neither should you.
