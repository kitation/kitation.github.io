I am currenly looking for a new tech role. I have been a backend web developer (Python, Ruby) for the last few years, but I really would like to move into a more people-centric role. I'm looking for service design/user research or similar. I would also be interested in working in the education sector around computing, or in a charity digital team.

I am really into education, digital inclusion and diversity. I have been a Code Club volunteer for two years and a DjangoGirls mentor. I also helped organise DjangoGirls Sheffield, and am currently a co-organiser of CodeUp Sheffield. My talk about designing services for trans and non-binary users has been given at several conferences and usergroups and has also been turned into a workshop. 

I am based in Sheffield but am able to commute to Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham. If you think I'd be a good fit for you, or you just would like to chat, contact info is on my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2f-FaRkuyThN0JpQ2ZOU1BueVE/view?usp=sharing) or you can catch me at ScotlandJS this week, NUX Manchester on Monday 6th or at UX Scotland on 8th and 9th.
