<p>&gt;I went through a phase as a teenager of insisting I go by boy names, like Liam or Paul (It was the Britpop era and I was 15, shut up). It was a time in my life when I didn't feel all that happy being female, my sexuality was still a mess of emotion and I was trying to crave out an identity in a system I felt was designed to shut me out. I'm overweight and clever, a somewhat unpleasant combination when it comes to school social circles. Anyway, I eventually settled on Chad, and I've had it ever since. (Named after http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Chad for the curious).</p>
<p>So what does Chad mean? Firstly, it's a name I picked for myself. I had issues with my parents at the time and felt that my real name wasn't really me. Secondly, despite being a popular boy name in the US, it's uncommon enough over here that it feels as unique as a name can really be without being stupid. Thirdly, as mentioned before my gender caused me a lot of issues as I was growing up, and so Chad became my cocky sarcastic "boy" half, while my actual name was my quiet emotional "girl" half. Later and now it's become more a symbol of gender neutrality, less "in-your-face" than a genderfucking but a similar idea. And lastly, it's good having something close to a real name I can use online and people know, but that no-one could look up and use to fuck with me.</p>
<p>Because before, the internet and real life were separate to an extent. I use Chad for everything online, and sometimes amongst real life friends whereas I use my real name for work, university and my parents. And that's fine. But now, with Twitter and social networking and that, I find the two worlds cross over a lot more and it's a pain to explain Chad to everyone I talk to. I'm doing interviews for my project lately, so I changed my MSN name to my real name, but it looks fake and uncomfortable. I feel like my real name is an emotional barrier, good for when I don't want to let people in but bad for when I do.</p>
<p>So there are two obvious solutions. 1) Change my name to Chad legally, this will make it more coherent but will upset my parents and I'll have to deal with people I can't stand calling me a name I find to be more connected with me. 2) Drop Chad altogether and use my real name for everything, again making it more coherent but losing that emotional connection with people I want to have it with. I feel childish having a nickname like that and people find it odd that in my mid-twenties I'm still emotionally about seventeen. Katie's dropped the whole kasumiastra pseudonym, shouldn't I do the same? Or I could keep the status quo, all the people that call me Chad now will probably always do so and I'll just stop using it for new people. My current university friends know me as both but only really call me Claire. It works, but it's sad.</p>
<p>Solution 3) Stop over-thinking it, it's just a bloody name!</p>
