<p>I do actually have a few non-stupid-meme blog posts in the works, I'll try and knock at least one of them out in the week. But for today you'll have to put up with watching the song I know all the words to.</p>

<p>Yeah the video is dated and the lyrics are ....weird but I loved this band. They are my definition, my fashion. They came crashing into my existence and dragged me through my teenage emotional fuckups. I love this song because it's weird, it came at a time when I was weird and I would love to thank them for it. </p>
<p>Oh, and the floppy haired guitarist in the pink shirt? I took his name, and I've been Chad in his honour ever since. </p>
