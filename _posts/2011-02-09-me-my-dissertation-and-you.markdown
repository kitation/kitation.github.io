<p>&gt;Hello all!</p>
<p>Following on from my earlier tweet I'm looking for women who currently work or have worked in IT, particularly in or around software development. I'm a final year software engineering student at Sheffield Hallam University and my dissertation is on the subject of software engineering, and how the perception of this has an effect on women's choice of career. I would like around 5 women to interview for around half an hour each, either face-to-face or via IM. My lack of mic and Skype's lack of decent Android developers means Skype would be pretty hard.</p>
<p>For more information, either DM me on Twitter(@kitation) or email at claire.gowler@googlemail.com</p>
