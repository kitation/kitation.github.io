<p>&gt;Hey all. If you are or have every worked in a job where you do/have done some computer programming or if programming/software is the main focus of the workplace OR you are or have been a student of a university course that involved programming or software development in some way...</p>
<p>I have a survey for you! <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gender-se-survey">http://tinyurl.com/gender-se-survey</a><br /><b><br /></b><br />This is for my dissertation on women and software engineering, however unlike the interviews men are very welcome to answer! The questionnaire will remain available for this week only, so please answer if you can. It is very short and should take 10 minutes or less. Thank you :)<b></b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Speaking of interviews, I will be available at the Gistmag(http://gistmag1103.eventbrite.com/) on Wednesday 2nd February if any ladies would like to have a 10 minute chat about this issues, as I am short of interviewees.<b><br /></b></p>
