<p>&gt;My least favourite song? That's kinda hard. There's a lot of music I don't like but if I don't like it I don't listen to it and that's all the thought I'd give it. I don't really rank them. So I had a look through my library for songs I've either never played or skipped the most and that didn't inspire me either. I can't get stuck at day 2 ;_;</p>
<p>So like a bitch I had a look at all the songs Katie likes and I can't stand and I picked this one.</p>

<p>Everything about this song irritates me, the video, the lyrics, everything. It's fucking awful.</p>
